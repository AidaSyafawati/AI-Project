# MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

## **A. PROJECT SUMMARY**

### _**Project Title:** Movie Recommendation System_

#### **Team Members:**

- Sumaya Azad Jerin

- Aida Syafawati Binti Abdullah

- Nur Fairuza Syahira Binti Nor Hidan

- Nur Fajar Adillah Binti Abdullah

#### **Objectives:**

- We will build a Movie Recommendation System which will take as input a movie title from the user and return the top 50 recommended movies to the user based on the input movie.

- We will use a movie dataset for our purpose. We will filter out which features to include to train our model and which features to exclude as there are many features which have no significance for recommendation purposes.

- It is a content based recommendation system and works pretty well!
